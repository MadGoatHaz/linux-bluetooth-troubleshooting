# Security Guide for Wiki Submission Tool

This document outlines the security features and best practices for using the Wiki Submission Tool safely and securely.

## Security Features

### Credential Protection

The Wiki Submission Tool implements multiple layers of credential protection:

1. **Runtime Entry Only**: Credentials are entered during script execution and never stored
2. **Hidden Input**: Password input is hidden during entry to prevent shoulder-surfing
3. **Memory Clearance**: Credentials are immediately overwritten and cleared from memory after use
4. **No Logging**: Credentials are never written to log files, temporary files, or stdout/stderr
5. **Process Isolation**: Temporary files use process IDs to prevent conflicts and unauthorized access

### Communication Security

1. **HTTPS Encryption**: All API communications use HTTPS encryption
2. **Direct API Communication**: No third-party data transmission
3. **User Agent Identification**: Scripts properly identify themselves to the API
4. **Certificate Validation**: SSL certificates are validated during communication

### Operational Security

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: All temporary files are automatically removed
2. **Secure File Names**: Temporary files use process IDs to prevent conflicts
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling without exposing credentials
4. **Process Trapping**: Cleanup occurs even if script is interrupted

## Security Options

### Secure Automation (Recommended)

For maximum security, use the secure submission scripts that prompt for credentials during execution:

- `wiki_secure_submission.sh` (Bash)
- `wiki_secure_submission.py` (Python)

These scripts provide:
- Runtime credential entry
- Hidden password input
- Immediate memory clearance
- Automatic cleanup

### Standard Automation

For convenience, standard automation scripts are available:
- File-based credentials (`wiki_credentials.conf`)
- Environment variable credentials

These methods are less secure but more convenient for automated environments.

## Best Practices

### Credential Management

1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. **Use secure file permissions** (chmod 600) for credential files
3. **Keep credentials local** and private
4. **Regularly rotate credentials** if using standard automation

### Environment Security

1. **Run in a secure environment** without keyloggers
2. **Verify script integrity** before running
3. **Close terminal after execution** for additional security
4. **Monitor network connections** during execution

### Network Security

1. **Use trusted networks** when submitting content
2. **Verify SSL certificates** to protect against MITM attacks
3. **Check network traffic** to ensure only connections to intended wikis

## Threat Model

### Protected Against

1. **Credential theft** through file system access
2. **Memory scraping** for credentials
3. **Network eavesdropping** of credentials
4. **Log file exposure** of credentials
5. **Unauthorized access** to temporary files

### Not Protected Against

1. **System-level compromise** (malware, rootkits)
2. **Physical security** (shoulder-surfing, cameras)
3. **Network-level attacks** (MITM without certificate validation)
4. **Social engineering** attacks
5. **Keyloggers** on the local system

## Auditing Security

### Self-Audit Checklist

1. [ ] Verify source code integrity
2. [ ] Check for unexpected network connections
3. [ ] Monitor file system access during execution
4. [ ] Verify temporary file cleanup
5. [ ] Confirm secure credential handling

### Monitoring

1. **System Logs**: Monitor for unusual activity
2. **Network Connections**: Check for unexpected connections
3. **File Access**: Monitor for unauthorized file access
4. **Process Activity**: Watch for suspicious processes

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security issues with these scripts:

1. **Do not post publicly** - Contact the repository maintainers directly
2. **Provide details** - Include the specific issue and potential impact
3. **Suggest fixes** - If possible, provide suggestions for addressing the issue

## Additional Security Measures

### For Maximum Security

1. **Use a dedicated user account** with minimal privileges
2. **Run in a secure environment** without keyloggers or screen capture software
3. **Use a VPN** if concerned about network-level surveillance
4. **Verify SSL certificates** to protect against MITM attacks
5. **Regularly update** your system and dependencies

### For Enterprise Use

1. **Implement additional access controls**
2. **Use dedicated secure environments**
3. **Regular security audits**
4. **Compliance verification**
5. **Incident response procedures**

## Compliance

This tool follows security best practices for handling credentials and should comply with most organizational security policies when used correctly.
